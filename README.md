# NLP Tasks with NLTK

This repository contains solutions for several NLP tasks using Python and NLTK:

- Downloaded the Brown corpus and listed all available text files in it. Also displayed the list of text files for another built-in corpus.
- Selected a novel from the Gutenberg corpus, tokenized the text, removed stopwords, and generated a word cloud to visualize the most frequent words.
- Chose a novel from the Gutenberg corpus, tokenized and preprocessed the text (stopword removal and stemming), identified the top 15 most frequent words before and after preprocessing, and visualized their frequency distributions.
- Extracted and printed the 50 most common bigrams from a Gutenberg novel, including bigrams with stopwords.
- Used the Hungarian corpus from the udhr dataset, extracted vowel sequences from words, constructed a bigram table for vowel pairs, and displayed the frequency distribution of vowel bigrams.
